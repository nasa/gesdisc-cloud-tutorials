    "\n",
    "The S3FS library is a FUSE-based service that allows for users to \"mount\" an S3 bucket and access it as if it were stored locally. It uses the botocore backend, and greatly simplifies accessing cloud-hosted data with Earthdata credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our credentials are retrieved using our previously generated .netrc file, we can \"mount\" the filesystem by passing our token information. Remember that these credentials only last for one hour, and once this time passes, the kernel must be reset and the cell below will need to be re-run."
